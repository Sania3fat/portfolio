# Project Overview
Primary objectives are to predict student enrollment and university revenue for upcoming fiscal and academic years for Kent State University. 

## Features
- Data Sources: Institutional Research, Enrollment Management, IPUMS, BLS, Census data, State of Ohio (SSI)
- Time Series Modeling: ARIMA, RNN
- Analysis: R and JMP

## Technologies Used
The analysis currently uses R, PowerBI, and JMP.

## Implementation
Data from diverse sources were collected to answer two related questions: 1) What will be the projected enrollment of students at Kent State University in the upcoming years, and 2) What will be the projected expected revenue for Kent State University. To answer these questions, we first collected data from diverse sources:

1. Demographic data: IPUMS, Census data
2. Enollment and Retention data: Institutional Research, and Enrollment Management
3. Financial Data: State of Ohio, Budget and Finance department, FAFSA, Information Technology (KSU)

Revenue predictions are highly dependent on accurace enrollment predictions with fees generated by student enrollment, and the state support for retention and graduation being a signifcant portion of the revenue generated. Additionally, Kent State uses a [Responsibility Center Management](https://www.kent.edu/budget/rcm-manual) model (RCM) to allocate revenue among colleges, which introduces further complexity in predicting revenue for colleges within the university. 

Student enrollment predictions were based on changes in demographics for college-age students, ethnicity, domestic or international, graduate or undergraduate, retention and persistence, and other demographic and census data variables. Data for the last 10 years (2014 to 2024) was used in these predictions.

Several time-series models were constructed. A few being:

1. Baseline:  Using value from time t to predict at t+1.
2. Simple moving average model
3. Exponential moving average model
4. Regression based forecasting
5. Ensemble model that was a combination of the regression based model, and a time-series model.

## Results

The results, by demographics on enrollment for Fall 2024 is given below for three of the models:

The prediction results underestimated final enrollment by about 3%, especially for students designated as "W" or "International." 

## Future Improvements

The current models only used a small fraction of the variables on which we had data. Our next step is to incorporate retention and persistence data in the models to improve prediction.
