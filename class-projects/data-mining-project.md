## Project Overview
Developed a comprehensive data mining solution for customer churn prediction using historical customer data. The project focused on identifying key indicators of customer churn and building a predictive model to help businesses retain customers.

## Course Objectives Met
- Applied supervised learning algorithms to real-world business problems
- Implemented data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques
- Evaluated model performance using various metrics
- Developed practical solutions for business stakeholders

## Technical Implementation

### Data Preprocessing
```python
# Example of data preprocessing steps
def preprocess_data(df):
    # Handle missing values
    df = df.fillna(df.mean())
    
    # Feature encoding
    categorical_cols = ['subscription_type', 'payment_method']
    df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=categorical_cols)
    
    # Feature scaling
    numerical_cols = ['tenure', 'monthly_charges']
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    df[numerical_cols] = scaler.fit_transform(df[numerical_cols])
    
    return df
```

### Model Development
- Implemented Random Forest Classifier
- Used k-fold cross-validation for model evaluation
- Performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Achieved 85% accuracy on test data

## Key Findings
1. Customer tenure strongly correlates with churn probability
2. Payment failures are a significant predictor of churn
3. Service usage patterns can indicate churn risk
4. Seasonal factors affect churn rates

## Visualizations
[Include relevant charts/graphs from your analysis]

## Challenges Faced
- Dealing with imbalanced class distribution
- Handling missing data in customer records
- Selecting relevant features for the model
- Optimizing model performance while avoiding overfitting

## Solutions Implemented
- Used SMOTE for handling class imbalance
- Implemented multiple imputation techniques
- Applied recursive feature elimination
- Used regularization techniques in model training

## Project Deliverables
1. Python notebook with complete analysis
2. Presentation slides for stakeholders
3. Final report with methodology and findings
